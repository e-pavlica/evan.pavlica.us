Source for my personal website.
Application server is Sinatra, views written in HAML. More info in the site's [colophon](http://pavlica.us/about)

I'm also using this site to build out my own CMS, **KeyMS**. It's a
Sinatra/Angular/Mongo app that'll be on the `/blog` route of my site until it's
ready to roll.

If you see code here you want to use, use it.

Made with <3 (or something like it) in Los Angeles by Evan Pavlica.
